# Contributing to Malachite

First, thank you for your interest in improving Malachite!

There are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. It doesn't matter if you are just getting started with Rust or are the most weathered expert, we can use your help.

No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

This document will help you get started. Do not let the document intimidate you. It should be considered as a guide to help you navigate the process.

**The [Telegram group][tg] is available for any concerns you may have that are not covered in this guide.**

If you contribute to this project, your contributions will be made to the project under Apache 2.0 license.

## Code of Conduct

### Contact: conduct@informal.systems

The Malachite project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct][rust-coc]. This code of conduct describes the minimum behavior expected from all contributors.

Violations of this Code of Conduct can be reported by contacting the team at `conduct@informal.systems`.

## Ways to contribute

There are three ways you can contribute to Malachite:

1. **By opening an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug
   in Malachite, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to report it.
2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues,
   such as screenshots and code snippets to help resolve issues.
3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either
   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often,
   by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and
   reviewable manner.

**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to participate in the discussion around bugs and
participate in reviewing PRs.

### Contributions Related to Spelling and Grammar

At this time, we will not be accepting contributions that only fix spelling or grammatical errors in documentation, code or
elsewhere.

### Getting Help

If you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions, or you are having problems, you can get help by *opening a discussion*. This repository comes with a discussion board where we welcome everyone to ask and offer help. Click the "Discussions" tab at the top of the repo.

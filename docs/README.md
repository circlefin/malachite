# Malachite Docs

> [!TIP]
> Malachite documentation is still in the early stages of development.
> We welcome contributions!
> We also invite feedback and input on what would be the most important aspects
> of documentation to cover, for [example](https://diataxis.fr/), tutorials,
> how-to guides, explanations, references?

## Building with Malachite

If you are a developer looking to _build_ with Malachite, then we suggest as a starting point:

1. The main [ARCHITECTURE.MD](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. The [tutorials](tutorials), which currently comprises an example of how to build a simple application with the high-level interface to a consensus provided by Malachite.

## Contributing to Malachite

If you are a developer looking to _contribute_ to Malachite or learn more,
then, in addition to the resources above, you may want to consult:

1. The log of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in [architecture](./architecture); these capture various decisions at previous points in time regarding architectural concerns.
2. The log of [development proposals](./development-proposals), which describes potential improvements or features for Malachite, depending on specific use cases such as the Starknet decentralized sequencer.
3. Some notes on [testing](./testing) Malachite locally within Docker.

# Consensus Algorithm

Malachite adopts the Tendermint consensus algorithm from the paper
["The latest gossip on BFT consensus"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938)
([PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04938)), by Ethan Buchman, Jae Kwon,
and Zarko Milosevic, last revised in November 2019.

The **pseudo-code** of the algorithm, referenced several times in this
specification, is the Algorithm in page 6, that for simplicity and easy
reference is copied into the [pseudo-code.md](./pseudo-code.md) file.

# Peer Discovery

We assume that nodes participating in the network do not have an _a priori_
knowledge of the network composition.
Instead, nodes are initialized with the addresses and identities of a subset of
nodes in the network, to which they establish an initial set of connections,
and from which they expect to retrieve addresses of other nodes.

Designed protocols:

# Starknet

Malachite originates as the consensus engine for implementing the decentralized sequencer of
[Starknet L2 network][starknet].

This directory contains the specification of various Starknet protocols, as they
interact and depend on Malachite's design:

- [Proofs Scheduling Protocol](./proofs-scheduling/README.md)
- [Forced Staking Updates and Reset Protocol](./validator-updates/README.md)
- [Proposal Parts Streaming Protocol](./block-streaming/README.md)

- In the protos, are we not conflating block parts with proposals?
- As per the proto, a Proposal is one of ProposalInit, ProposalFin, Transactions or BlockProof
- In Malachite, we need a Proposal which contains the following data:
  - height
  - round
  - block hash
  - POL round
  - validator
- To me it seems like the suggested Proposal type corresponds better to what we call a BlockPart
